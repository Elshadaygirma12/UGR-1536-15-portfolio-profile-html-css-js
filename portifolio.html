        <h3>Certificate for compliting Fundamentals of programming course</h3>
        <p>
            I recently earned a certificate in Web Development from Udacity.
            Through the program, I gained valuable knowledge in front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks. 
            This experience has not only deepened my understanding of web development but also equipped me with the tools to build engaging digital experiences. 
            I'm looking forward to applying these skills in future projects!

        <h3>Screenshot of my GitHub repository</h3>
        <p>
            I recently completed several projects in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Front-End Development (FSE), and I'm proud to showcase a screenshot of
            my GitHub repository highlighting these achievements. The repository features a variety of projects that demonstrate my understanding of key concepts in DSA, 
            including efficient algorithms and data organization, alongside visually appealing front-end applications. Each project is well-documented, showcasing my coding skills 
            and attention to detail. This screenshot not only reflects my technical proficiency but also my commitment to continuous learning and improvement in the field of software development.

        <p>
            Receiving a certificate from my school for participating in charity is a meaningful recognition of my commitment to giving back to the community. This experience not only allowed me to contribute to important causes but also helped me develop empathy and teamwork skills. I am proud to have been part of a collective effort to make a positive difference, and this certificate serves as a reminder of the impact we can have when we come together for a common goal.
